Hi, I'm Lucy Sonberg 👋
Data Management Student | Building Responsible AI Systems
I'm a Data Manager student at TUC Yrkeshögskolan, specializing in data governance, security, and architecture. My focus is on building the data foundations that enable AI systems to work safely and responsibly in enterprise environments.
Currently seeking LIA placement (Dec 2025 - Apr 2026) where I can contribute to data governance, AI compliance, or data engineering initiatives.

🎯 What I Do
I combine formal education in data management with hands-on AI development to solve real-world challenges:

Data Governance & Compliance: Building systems that respect privacy, GDPR, and EU data regulations
AI & Machine Learning: Exploring memory systems, agentic AI, and responsible AI deployment
Data Engineering: ETL pipelines, graph databases, and data quality automation

My approach bridges theoretical knowledge with practical implementation—turning data governance principles into working systems.

🤝 Looking to Collaborate
I'm always open to building together! Especially interested in:

🤖 Agentic AI systems - Building autonomous agents with proper governance
📱 Production applications - Real-world apps that solve actual problems
🔐 GDPR-compliant AI - Making AI work within regulatory frameworks
🌐 Graph-based solutions - Relationship modeling and network analysis

Want to build something together? Reach out! I'm particularly interested in projects that combine AI capabilities with responsible data practices.
