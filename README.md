Hi, I'm Lucy Sonberg 👋
Specializing in data governance meets AI development — because the best AI systems are those built on solid data foundations.
Currently seeking internship opportunities (Dec 2025 - Apr 2026) where I can contribute to AI infrastructure, data engineering, or governance initiatives.

🎯 What I Focus On

Memory architectures that respect privacy & GDPR
AI governance frameworks for enterprise deployment
Graph-based relationship modeling for complex systems
Automated data quality with ML-powered pipelines

Open to building together! Especially interested in:

🤖 AI agents with memory systems that respect privacy rules
📱 Real-world applications solving actual business problems
🔐 Compliance-first AI - making regulation an advantage, not a blocker
🌐 Knowledge graphs - because relationships matter
